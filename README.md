# Predicting bank customer churn

In this project I try to pinpoint the factors that contribute to customers leaving a bank and build a predictive model that classifies whether a client churns or not.

I use ensemble methods and more precisely Random Forest and the powerful LightGBM. The two models work quite well, even though we have imbalanced data(much more people stay), and I managed to get high performance metric scores across the board.
